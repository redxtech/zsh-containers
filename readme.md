# zsh-containers

> zsh-containers is a zsh plugin that provides aliases and better interoperability between podman and docker commands based on which you have installed.

## installing

### zinit

Add this to your zinit config (.zshrc):

```zsh
zinit light redxtech/zsh-containers

# it also works with turbo mode:
zinit ice wait lucid
zinit load redxtech/zsh-containers
```

### oh-my-zsh

Install it with your favourite zsh package manager, or clone it directly to your `$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins` directory with git, and add `containers` to the plugins array in your `.zshrc` file:

```zsh
plugins=(... containers)
```

## completion

i would recommend using [greymd/docker-zsh-completion](https://github.com/greymd/docker-zsh-completion) for up-to-date completions pulled weekly from upstream.

## podman -> docker

since `podman` and `docker` commands are mostly interchangable, people will often use `alias docker="podman"`, and it usually works fine - however, if you also use `docker compose`, it might be not work if you run compose via `docker compose`, since `podman compose` isn't a command - you have to run `podman-compose`, which isn't exactly compatible with the alias method.

to solve that, i've made a `docker` function, that detects if the first argument is `compose`. if that's the case, it removes that argument, and passes the rest to `podman-compose`. for any other first argument, it passes them all to podman.

if you don't use podman or podman-compose, then this plugin won't change any of this.
